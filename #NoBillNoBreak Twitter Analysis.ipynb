The text above doesn't seem to be a coherent sentence, but that is because we removed stopwords earlier, so only the \"important\" words are left.\n",

    "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">55 years ago today, I was one of 13 original Freedom Riders who set out to integrate America&#39;s buses. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/goodtrouble?src=hash\">#goodtrouble</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5SDpHMgcMl\">pic.twitter.com/5SDpHMgcMl</a></p>&mdash; John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/repjohnlewis/status/727908088133652485\">May 4, 2016</a></blockquote>\n",

It is a reference to the trouble he got in (i.e. involvement in sit-ins and being arrested multiple times) during the civil rights movement.

    "\n",
    "Lewis appears to have been the first to use the phrase in reference to the Democrats' demonstration on the House floor, which caused it to become so popular in the tweets sample. He used this phrase because the Democrats believed that even though they were breaking the rules and getting in trouble (they were occupying the well of the House during a session, as well as using electronic devices on the House floor to stream the demonstration), it was 'good trouble' since their motivation was protecting American lives."

    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this simple analysis of the tweets about #NoBillNoBreak, it appears there was much support for House Democrats, and some contempt for Speaker Paul Ryan. I will not make a formal conclusion, since the goal of this analysis was to get a basic idea of what was being said about the event, and a much deeper analysis would be required. What is clear is that the debate over gun control is likely to continue for quite some time, and seems to be getting much more heated as time goes on and the political gridlock strengthens."
